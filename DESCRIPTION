Title: Satellite Nightlight Data Extraction
Description: Extracts raster and zonal statistics
    from satellite nightlight rasters downloaded from the United States 
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<http://www.noaa.gov>) 
    free data repositories. Both the DMSP-OLS annual and SNPP-VIIRS monthly 
    nightlight raster data are supported. Satellite nightlight raster tiles are 
    downloaded and cropped to the country boundaries using shapefiles from the GADM
    database of Global Administrative Areas (<http://gadm.org>). Zonal statistics
    are then calculated at the lowest administrative boundary for the selected
    country and cached locally for future retrieval. Finally, a simple data
    explorer/browser is included that allows one to visualize the cached data e.g.
    graphing, mapping and clustering regional data.
