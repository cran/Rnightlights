## Nightlights for R

### ChangeLog
v0.1.1:
Initial release

v0.1.2:
+ Fixed a problem that was causing processNlData() and getCtryNlData() to return all NAs
+ Changed the naming system of downloaded and renamed VIIRS tiles to remove the underscore between year and month thus making it nlPeriod uniform with the OLS tiles. Also added a dummy tileName to the end of the renamed OLS tile to make it uniform with VIIRS tiles. Thus the format is now "nlType_nlPeriod_tileName.tif/tgz". This fixes a problem with listCtryNlTiles() which was causing it to crash.
+ Divided area by 1e6 to convert square meters to square kilometers
+ Exported getCtryRasterOutputFname to allow exploreData to access clipped country rasters
+ Modified exploreData to embed the country raster in the map
+ Exported nlPeriod functions to list and check validity of nlPeriods
+ General updates in shiny app
+ Fixed raster display in maps. Still large maps will be slow
+ Made stats radio buttons dynamic
+ Fixed OLS tile download where multiple URLs were returned. Picking only first. May be prudent to download both and process returning average of the two.
+ Added missing pkgOption numCores for parallel processing when raster pkgOptions are selected

v0.1.3:
+Fixed a bug in calculation of stats using "gdal" where functions apart from mean, sum and var would fail.
+Introduction of the raster layer in the exploreData map display
+Various minor code and documentation updates
