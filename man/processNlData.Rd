\usage{
processNlData(ctryCodes = getAllNlCtryCodes("all"),

}
\arguments{
\item{ctryCodes}{the list of countries to be processed}

\item{nlPeriods}{the nlPeriods of interest}

\item{nlType}{the type of nightlights to process i.e. "OLS" or "VIIRS". Default "VIIRS"}

in \code{pkgOptions("stats")}}

None

\description{
Downloads nightlight tiles and country polygons in preparation for the appropriate functions
    to process them. Given a list of countries and nlPeriods and an nlType, processNlData 
    will first determine which countries and periods do not actually have data i.e. have not 
    been previously processed. From the list of countries and prediods that need processing,
    it determines which nightlight tiles require to be downloaded. At the same time, it 
    downloads any country polygons which have not already been downloaded.
}
\details{
processNlData then calls processNlCountry with the nlType supplied as a parameter. The
    processing is essentially the same for all nlTypes.

This is the main entry-point to the package and the main user-facing function. However, it 
    works in batch mode and caches all data without returning any data to the user. However, it 
    will return TRUE/FALSE depending on whether it completed successfully. Since it saves state
    regularly it can be run multiply in case of failure until it finally returns TRUE. This is where 
    the only constraints are downloading and processing errors due to bandwidth or other 
    resource constraints. A good example is running a long-running batch on an AWS EC2 
    spot-priced machine where the server may be decommissioned at any time. See more in the examples.

#Example 1: process VIIRS nightlights for all countries and all periods available e.g. to create 
    #a local cache or repo

    #so that they do not have to be re-evaluated multiply
    nlInit() 
    
    processNlData() #process VIIRS nightlights for all countries and all periods

#Example 2: process nightlights for all countries in 2012 only
    
    nlInit() #for performance. See Example 1

    nlPeriods <- getAllNlYears("VIIRS") #get a list of all nightlight periods to present-day

    nlPeriods <- nlPeriods[grep("^2012", nlPeriods)] #filter only periods in 2012
