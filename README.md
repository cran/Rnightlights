## Nightlights for R

The Rnightlights package extracts raster and zonal statistics from satellite nightlight rasters downloaded from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<http://www.noaa.gov>) free data repositories. 

Both the DMSP-OLS annual and SNPP-VIIRS monthly nightlight raster data are supported. Satellite nightlight raster tiles are downloaded and cropped to the country boundaries using shapefiles from the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas (<http://gadm.org>). Zonal statistics are then calculated at the lowest administrative boundary for the selected country and cached locally for future retrieval. Finally, a simple data explorer/browser is included that allows one to visualize the cached data e.g. graphing, mapping and clustering regional data.
